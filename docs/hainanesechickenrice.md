**1 whole organic corn-fed chicken | 5cm unpeeled sliced ginger | 2 spring onions | 2tsp salt | 1/2tsp MSG | 1tbsp sesame oil | 5tbsp light soy sauce**  
To prepare the poached chicken, pound the unpeeled ginger in a mortar and pestle and add to a very large pot with 4 litres of water. Add salt and MSG to the pot. Bring to boil over high heat and taste the water. It should be a little savoury. Cut off the tail and fats bits of the chicken and save for later. Give it a rinse and rub plentiful table salt over the skin. Rub off the loose bits and make it smooth smooth smooth. Chop big chunks of spring onion and more slices of ginger and put inside the chicken. Put the soy sauce in the cavity. Place the chicken in the pot, can use hooks to prevent it from touching the bottom. Sink and lift the chicken a couple of times in the water to fill it up in the cavity. Cook the chicken for 45 minutes on a steam. The heat should be low and the water shouldn't be bubbling.

**3 1/2 cups jasmine rice | 1/4 cup vegetable oil | 4 cloves garlic | 2 roughly sliced shallots | 2-3 pandan leaves, optional**  
To prepare the chicken rice, chop up the removed tail and fats stuff from the chicken and fry in a small pan on a low heat to render out the fat. When done, add vegetable oil to make up 1/2 cup of oil in total. Pound the garlic and shallot in a mortar and pestle, and add to the pan. Add this to the rice cooker along with the chicken stock from the pot. Tie the pandan leaves in a knot and add to the rice. Now would be a good time to make the ginger spring onion sauce and chilli ginger sauce.

**~1/2 cup sesame oil**  
When you feel the chicken is done, lift it out of the pot and place in salted iced water for at least ten minutes, turning once. Drain the chicken from the water and rub all over with sesame oil. Use a cleaver to slice up and de-bone the chicken, slices not too thick.
