**4 salmon fillets | 1/2 cup soy sauce | 1/2 cup sesame oil**  
Marinate the salmon in soy sauce and sesame oil. Make a few cuts in the salmon skin so the marinade can penetrate and it won't curl when it gets fried.

**1 tbsp sugar | fish sauce | soy sauce | 3 spring onions | salt | pepper**  
To cook the tomatoes, first add sugar, fish sauce, and a little soy sauce. Cook the tomatoes down into a sauce, using a fork to squish them a bit. The sauce needs to cook for at least 20 minutes, mixing every so often. Near the end add the spring onions, and salt and pepper to taste. Save some spring onions for serving.

In a seperate pan, fry the salmon in a neutral oil skin side first. Flip after maybe five minutes, then cook for one more minute. Don't overcook it! The salmon should finish cooking in the sauce. Place them in the tomato sauce pan skin side up and cook for another two minutes. Serve with spring onions on top.
