    <strong>400g or 2 whole chicken breasts | 1-2 cans coconut milk | 4cm chunk galangal | 3 fresh lemongrass stalks | 2 tsp lemongrass paste, optional</strong>

    <br>The first flavours going into the soup are galangal and lemongrass. Thinly slice the galangal, halve the lemongrass stalks and put them a pot 
    on medium heat with half of the coconut milk. If lemongrass paste is available then add to the pot. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and plop 
    them in, along with the rest of the coconut milk. Turn the heat down to medium low whilst the chicken cooks. 
    During the cooking, the soup should never be bubbling or roaring. Just let it steam, be gentle, and go low and slow. 
    Also try only to stir in one direction because the coconut milk is delicate.</p>

    <strong>5-10 thai chillies | 1 large / 2 small white onions | 2 handfuls oyster mushrooms | 1 small aubergine | 8 kaffir lime leaves | 1 tsp salt</strong>

    <br>Whilst the chicken is slowly cooking, we will add all the other main bulk to the soup. 
    Slice the thai chillies diagonally, tear the oyster mushrooms into bite-sized pieces, cut the onions into thick slices, 
    chop the aubergine into small mouthful cubes, and release the flavour from the kaffir lime leaves by smacking between your hands. 
    Add them all to the soup and stir it up. Add salt and taste. Allow the soup to cook gently for fifteen minutes or so. 
    The last thing to get soft should be the aubergine.</p>

    <strong>2 tomatoes</strong>

    <br>When you feel the soup is pretty much done, cut the tomatoes into thick wedges and add them to the soup. 
    If you want softer tomatoes then you can add them earlier and cook them in longer, but caution 
    - Thai mums say that tom kha gai should not be pink.</p>

    <strong>4 tbsp lime juice | 1 small bunch coriander</strong>

    <br>After one or two minutes or when the tomatoes are as cooked as you prefer, switch off the heat and add the chopped coriander and lime juice. 
    Taste again and adjust salty and sour if needed. Sometimes I put a splash of fish sauce for an extra zing.</p>
