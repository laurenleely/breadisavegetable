    <strong>700g mild mushrooms | 8 tbsp butter | salt | pepper</strong>

    <br>Rip the mushrooms with your hands into nice sized pieces. 
    In four batches, saute the mushrooms in a heavy pan with 2 tbsp butter, salt and pepper in each go. Set aside.</p>

    <strong>1 1/2 tbsp butter | 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil | 1 cup finely chopped leek | 1 1/4 cups arborio rice | 1/4 cup dry white wine | 1/4 cup dry vermouth</strong>

    <br>Melt the remaining 1 1/2 tbsp butter in the pan with olive oil. Add leek with a little salt, fry lightly until tender for 4-5 minutes. 
    Add rice and and increase heat just a bit. Stir continuously for about 4-5 minutes, until the edges of the grains look translucent. 
    Add white wine and vermouth and let absorb for 1 minute.</p>

    <strong>7 cups low salt chicken broth</strong>

    <br>Add chicken broth cup by cup, each time stirring the broth in until almost all dissolved before pouring next cup in. 
    When rice is half cooked, about ten minutes in, add the mushrooms. Keep going until the rice is nice and creamy, not overcooked not undercooked.</p>

    <strong>handful parmesan | tiny sprinkle truffle salt</strong>

    <br>When the rice is done to your taste, add salt and pepper, and grated parmesan. 
    Don't make it too cheesy because the parmesan easily overpowers the other flavours! If serving with truffle salt, make sure the rice isn't too salty already.</p>
